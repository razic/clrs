## 1.1-1

Q: Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that
requires computing a convex hull.

A: For sorting, common applications include efficient searching, and merging.
For computing convex hulls, common applications include pattern recognition,
image processing, and more.

## 1.1-2

Q: Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a
real-world setting?

A: Memory, storage, power consumption, accuracy, reliabilty.

## 1.1-3

Q: Select a data structure that you have seen previously and discuss its
strengths and limitations.

A: An array is a data structure that represents a collection of elements. It's
strength is that the position of each element can be computed from its index
tuple. Memory-wise, arrays are compact data structures with no per-element
overhead. A limitation to arrays is that one must iterate through an entire
array to find a given element.

## 1.1-4

Q: How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above
similar? How are they different?

A: They are similar in that they both want to find the most efficient route.
However, the traveling-salesman problem is different in that it takes ordering
into account, making the problem NP-Complete.

## 1.1-5

Q: Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do.
Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best good
enough.

A: Finding the shortest path, and traveling-salesman, respectively.
